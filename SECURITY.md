# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

This is a personal portfolio/demo project. Security fixes may be applied intermittently.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security issue, please do not open a public issue.
Instead, contact the maintainer privately with:

- a clear description of the issue
- steps to reproduce
- impact assessment
- suggested fixes (if any)

## Repo Hygiene

- Do not commit secrets (API keys, passwords, tokens, private keys) to this repository.
- Kubernetes Secret manifests should be templates/examples only (no real values).
