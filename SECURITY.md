# Security Policy

## Supported Versions
This is a personal portfolio/demo project. Security updates may be applied intermittently.

## Reporting a Vulnerability
If you discover a security issue, please do not open a public issue.
Instead, contact the maintainer privately with:
- a clear description of the issue
- steps to reproduce
- impact assessment (what data/systems could be affected)
- any suggested fixes

## Scope Notes
- Do not commit secrets (API keys, passwords, tokens, private keys) to this repository.
- Kubernetes Secret manifests should use templates/examples only (no real values).
